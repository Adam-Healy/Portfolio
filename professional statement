I am enthusiastic and curious about Cybersecurity because the field needs more people to mitigate risk of intrusion to computers 
and make the internet a safer place.
I place an important role of protecting and maintaining computer networks that hold sensitive data
and reduce the risk of unauthorised access.

My programming skills like Python and C# can be used effectively to develop encryption algorithms to 
protect sensitive data. Implement secure transmission protocols like HTTPS,SSH or SSL/TLS to 
safeguard network communications

What interests me most about Cybersecurity is its constant evolving field due to the continuous 
development of new threats and technologies. This keeps me constantly learning and staying updated with 
security advancements, making it more challenging and exciting.
